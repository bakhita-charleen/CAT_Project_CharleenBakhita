The conference is a 3-day event with the first two days being talks and sessions and the last day purely focused on workshops. The event is designed to create a platform to interact and educate on API literacy, something that has been found lacking in the tech scene across Africa based on conversations with Engineering Managers, Software Engineers, and other stakeholders. </p>

SheHacks KE is a community of Women in Cybersecurity from various backgrounds and counties in Kenya coming together to purposefully provide for women in cybersecurity an avenue of interaction, growth in knowledge and skill set and successfully pave a path for them in the cybersecurity industry.
The need to establish the initiative came about upon realization of a lack of female representation in the industry, notably in the workplace and at conferences.
The objective of establishing SheHacks_KE was to provide a platform for women to interact, learn and grow together as information security learners and professionals.</p>
