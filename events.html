                <h2>API Festival</h2>
                <p> I participated in API festival that was held in Sarit expo centre from 17th August to 19th August 2023.API Festival is a premier event for developers in Africa who want to learn about the latest trends and best practices in the API industry. The conference is a 3-day event with the first two days being talks and sessions and the last day purely focused on workshops. The event is designed to create a platform to interact and educate on API literacy, something that has been found lacking in the tech scene across Africa based on conversations with Engineering Managers, Software Engineers, and other stakeholders. </p>

                <h2>Shehacks.Ke</h2>
                <p>I also participated in Shehacks.KE conference that was held in United States International University from 21st September to 23rd September 2023.SheHacks KE is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2016 by Laura Tich and Evelyn Kilel and Patricia Jerotich, with the aim of providing women in cybersecurity a platform to interact and help each other grow professionally in a healthy environment.
SheHacks KE is a community of Women in Cybersecurity from various backgrounds and counties in Kenya coming together to purposefully provide for women in cybersecurity an avenue of interaction, growth in knowledge and skill set and successfully pave a path for them in the cybersecurity industry.
The need to establish the initiative came about upon realization of a lack of female representation in the industry, notably in the workplace and at conferences.
The objective of establishing SheHacks_KE was to provide a platform for women to interact, learn and grow together as information security learners and professionals.</p>
